### 3. Time Series Analysis: Finding Peak Shopping Times

To provide more granular recommendations, I performed a time series analysis to identify the busiest shopping periods. By extracting the hour and day of the week from each transaction, I could pinpoint the "golden hours" for the business and create a data-driven marketing schedule.

**Findings:**
- **The Golden Window:** The vast majority of sales occur between **10 AM and 3 PM, Tuesday through Thursday**.
- **Peak Day:** **Thursday** is the day with the highest overall sales volume.
- **The Saturday Anomaly:** A critical finding was the complete absence of sales data for Saturdays, which requires immediate investigation.

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1.  **Strategic Marketing:** Schedule all promotional campaigns to launch by 10 AM on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday to maximize impact.
2.  **Data Integrity Check:** Launch an internal investigation to determine if the missing Saturday data is a business reality (i.e., the store is closed) or a technical data collection error.
